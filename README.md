## 🛠️ Code Overview
This stopwatch uses **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** to implement a simple yet functional timer. The key concepts used include:

- **`setInterval()`** ⏲️ to update the timer in real-time every 10 milliseconds.
- **Date Objects (`new Date()`, `Date.now()`)** 🗓️ to calculate elapsed time.
- **String Formatting (`padStart()`)** 🔢 to maintain a consistent display format.
- **Event Handling (`onclick` events)** 🎯 to start, stop, and reset the timer.

The JavaScript logic calculates the elapsed time based on the difference between the start time and the current time, ensuring precision in tracking time.
